I was very bored. However, within the code there is a little bit of magic going on with memoizing and caching. Nothing fancy tough - all library stuff.

To get fast version, compile as follows:

stack build
run with -writemap and workdir set to root of project (shoule generate map file)
stack clean
stack build
